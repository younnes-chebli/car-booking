# Car Booking Project
As an admin for a car company I would like to have an application to book cars and view users.

When booking a new car should the application ask for:
* The user id which must be generated by the system.
* The car to be booked

### We will also ensure that:
* We use OOP
* We separate our domain from the business logic
* We use packages to organize our code
* We use the right naming conventions for classes, methods and packages.

## Features to be implemented
* Book Car
* View All User Booked Cars
* View All Bookings
* View Available Cars
* View Available Electric Cars
* View All Users

## Important
* We will use Arrays to hold any data. We will not use Lists at the first point. We will later.
* We also won't use dependency injection at this point. We will later.
